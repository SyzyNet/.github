## About us
SyzyNet is a company based around Web Application Security founded in 2022. Any free software we make will always have it's code released as open source under our github!

Our Goal is to make obtaining tools and knowledge much easier for the general population, we wish to see everyone practicing and employing the best security techniques as painlessly as possible

We started out as a simple group developing cheats for VRChat, and decided to move on to bigger and better things.
